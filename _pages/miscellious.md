In my 13 years old, it was my first business creating $500 USD per month. I learned how to host a server, prevent DDoS attacks, use SQL Databases, optimize the experience, handling relationships with other competitors, and program a game. During the process, many players and developers who enjoyed my server joined the team and helped to create texture, videos, etc... for my server.'

    excerpt: '**Image: Screen shot of my sponge block in game**<br/>---<br/>Time: `2018`<br/>Achievements: `added another End Dimension in the game` `added sponge blocks in the game`<br/><br/> >> This highschool competition, organized by Google, divides real world problems from various companies into smaller tasks for competitors to choose from and finalize. I joined an open-source project on Github developing a game called Terasology. There, I implemented a new Sponge Block and a new End Biome using Java. Not only did this give me an award for recognition, it also taught me the method of task division that I used to provide learning opportunities to novices in my robotics club. This way, they can merge with other team members easily.'

The theme song relates the patterns ofn the logistical map to peopleâ€™s auditory system, creating an intuitive way to interpret chaos theory. The project (see button below) creates an interactive 3D demo using a 3-body system. It also generates a logistical map representing the sensitivity of different parameters.'

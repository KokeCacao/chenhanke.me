    excerpt: 'This was a well-known Minecraft Server in China founded, hosted, and coded by myself in my 13 years old. It was my first buesness creating $500 USD per month in 2014. The most challenging aspect in hosting the server is to learn different techniques to prevent DDoS attacks, use SQL Databases, optimize experience, handling relationships with other competators, and program a game. During the process, many players and developers who enjoyed my server joined the team and helped creating texture, videos, ect... for my server. It is one of the most exciting experience for me dare to intrude into adult-society.'

In my 13 years old, it was my first business creating $500 USD per month. I learned how to host a server, prevent DDoS attacks, use SQL Databases, optimize the experience, handling relationships with other competitors, and program a game. During the process, many players and developers who enjoyed my server joined the team and helped to create texture, videos, etc... for my server.'

I joined an open-source project on Github developing a game called Terasology. There, I implemented a new Sponge Block and a new End Biome using Java. Not only does it give me an award for recognition, it also tought me the method of tasks division that I used for prividing learning opportunities to novice in my robotics club. This way, they can merge with other team members easily.'

The theme song relates the patterns on the logistic map to peopleâ€™s auditory system, creating an intuitive way to interpret chaos theory. The project (see button below) creates a 3D interactive demo using 3-body system. It also generates a logistic map representing the sensitivity of different parameters.'

    excerpt: '**Video: Report Presentation**<br/>---<br/>Time: `2018`<br/>Achievements: `Model Prediction Accuracy 63.07%`<br/><br/> >> I implemented a Convolution Neural Network with Residue and Squeeze-Excitation layers classifier to locate given proteins of any type in a subcellular structure. After training the model using a series of techniques, it can locate thousands of proteins in 27 different human cell types into 28 subcellular locations, way significant than historical approaches. The model can classify 4,500 images per minute with an accuracy of 63.07%, surpassing human performance in accuracy (by 35%) and speed.'

With our new proposed "three-stage method", we are able to achieve +0.02 accuracy on the test dataset.'

I first loaded a human face dataset from scikit-learn and detected faces as a practice. After training the dataset using ResNet50 architecture, I found out that the pre-trained model could out-compete the performance of OpenCV library by about 10% accuracy. Then, I went a step further; predicting dog breeds using CNN and trained it from scratch. Although the accuracy of standard CNN is low (9.2% accuracy), with ResNet50 architecture, I was able to successfully classify 41.5% of the dogs into 133 correct categories, far better than my own performance.'

The parameters(learning rates) are hard to tune, but after only one epoch, the network could output recognizable handwritings and faces completely generated by the computer, derived from random numbers.'

Usually, people have to control four different motors to ensure that drones do not crash, but  with this algorithm, you can tell a drone “x,y,z” where it should go, and it can go there automatically.'

My motivation for learning AI is that it can be used in many fields. “It is only a tool,” I thought but later I realized that the theory of training neural networks can be used for human learning too. “The biggest benefit that AI brought to us is not only a strong algorithm but also the theory of learning.”

My interest in wanting to know the fundamental mechanisms behind AI drove me into Udacity’s Machine Learning online course. In 1.5 years, I graduated from Machine Learning (Basics) and Deep Learning (Advanced) Nanodegrees. Although the knowledge these courses provide is too basic compared to tricks used in Kaggle competitions by PHDs and graduate students, these courses introduced me to a group of alumni and dragged me into the AI research circle. Three years ago, I started with nothing, but now I compete with other AI researchers as a high school student.

Here are some projects I did as I gradually entered the field of AI.

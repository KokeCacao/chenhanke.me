    excerpt: '**Video: 3D Structure of the Robot**<br/>---<br/>`Time: 2018-2020`<br/>Position: `Computer Vision Engineer`<br/><br/> >> I joined Robotics At Maryland (R@M) by chance when I was looking for donations for SSFS Robotics, becaming their youngest member. I am currently working with students from R@M to build an underwater robot for Robosub competition. I use Deep Learning algorisms to improve the vision of their robot in water. Specifically, I used Nasnet-mobile architecture to train task-specific object recognizable computer vision system for navigation.'

    excerpt: '**Image: Reinforcement Algorithm and the Robot**<br/>---<br/>`Time: 2018`<br/>Achievements: `Reinforcement Learning Algorithm`<br/><br/> >> In this summer school, I followed Stanford CS231n curriculum and programmed a robot capable of doing tasks like dancing, sweeping the floor, solving the maze. I also used Reinforcement Learning to optimize the path taking with dynamic rick calculation. This technology I programmed is important because it allows the robot to perform dynamic path planning under different unknown environments.<br/>(Jupyter Notebook)[/assets/html/ReinforcementLearningOnHamster.html]'

    excerpt: '**Picture: Competing in FIRST Tech Challenge**<br/>---<br/>`Time: 2017-2020`<br/>Achievements: `Judges Award` `First Ranked Team in local` `Advanced to Maryland State Chaimpionship`<br/><br/> >> My friend Qian and I created SSFS Robotics Club in my Sophmore year. We got donations from Kuka and built the robot in 2 weeks before the midterm and got the Judges Award in FTC Competition. However, ALL the members of the team left in the second year, so I decided to restart the club on my own. After many joined the team, we designed a new team logo, hoodies, websites, and looked for donations from the school and several other companies. Finally, we were placed 1st in the Qualifier and got into Maryland State Championship and became one of the biggest clubs in the school.'

Robotics is a product of Engeneering, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence. AI is its brain where as engeneering creates its body.

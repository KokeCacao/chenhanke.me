    excerpt: 'I am currently working with students from Robotics At Maryland (R@M) to build an underwater robot for Robosub competition. I use Deep Learning algorisms to improve the vision of their robot in water. Specifically, I used Nasnet-mobile architecture to train task-specific object recognizable computer vision system for navigation.'

    excerpt: 'In this summer school, I followed Stanford CS231n curriculum and programmed a robot capable of doing tasks like dancing, sweeping the floor, solving the maze. I also used Reinforcement Learning to optimize the path taking with dynamic rick calculation. This technology I programmed is important because it allows the robot to perform dynamic path planning under different unknown environments.'

    excerpt: 'My friend Qian and I created SSFS Robotics Club in my Sophmore year. We got donations from Kuka and built the robot in 2 weeks before the midterm and got the Judges Award in FTC Competition. However, ALL the members of the team left in the second year, so I decided to restart the club on my own. After many joined the team, 11 of us designed a new team logo, hoodies, websites, and looked for donations from the school and several other companies. Finally, we were placed 1st in the Qualifier and got into Maryland State Championship.'

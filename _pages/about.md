    excerpt: '**Video: Timelapse of me doing Kaggle**<br/>---<br/>Time: `2018-2020`<br/>Medals: `2 Kernel Bronze` `3 Discussion Silver` `34 Discussion Bronze`<br/><br/> >> My adult-classmates from Udacity introduced me to Kaggle: a platform of online research-level AI competitions. Here, I analyzed data and created models for companies like TGS, CAMPS, and HPA in the frontier research of geology, biology, and chemistry. During the school days, I had to monitor the training process of my model between class periods and during breaks. It exites me everytime I use my own hypotheisis to come up with a solution that breakes a reacord. This experience surely becomes one of my biggest habits and challenges.'

In my 13 years old, it was my first business creating $500 USD per month. I learned how to host a server, prevent DDoS attacks, use SQL Databases, optimize the experience, handling relationships with other competitors, and program a game. During the process, many players and developers who enjoyed my server joined the team and helped to create texture, videos, etc... for my server.'

We got donations from Kuka and built the robot in 2 weeks before the midterm and got the Judges Award in FTC Competition. However, ALL the members of the team, including my friend graduated in the second year. As more and more students joined our club I have to restart the club on my own. After many joined the team, we designed a new team logo, hoodies, websites, and looked for donations from the school and several other companies. It soon became the biggest club in our school. Finally, we were placed 1st in the Qualifier and got into Maryland State Championship.<br/>'

From learning painting, designing animations, and making independent video game... From my first public game server with 344,941 users in 2015 to self-studying Deep Learning on Udacity nano-degree, my exploration in many fields of science led me to explore the applications of Artificial Intelligence in different fields. In there, I have earned the opportunities to compete on Kaggle and discuss tricks with many data scientists and PhDs. From Playground to Research competitions, I have to read many lastest publications and sometimes implement papers published last month to my algorisms to improve my models. Like so, new challenges begin as I wake up every morning.

    excerpt: '**Video: Timelapse of me competing on Kaggle**<br/>---<br/>Time: `2018-2020`<br/>Medals: `2 Kernel Bronze` `3 Discussion Silver` `34 Discussion Bronze`<br/><br/> >> I actively researched using Kaggle’s dataset across multiple disciplines (medicine, biology, physics, chemistry, geology, etc.) Through the platform’s frequent themed competitions, I competed against graduate students and field experts in building predictive models to solve research and industrial problems where I learned how to cooperate with other research-competitors, how to use statistical analysis tools for different types of problems, and to adapt experimental methods in practice.'

    excerpt: '**Video: KokiCraft Trailer**<br/>---<br/>Time: `2014-2018`<br/>Achievements: `First Business Created by Myself` `344,941 players` `$500 USD/month`<br/><br/> >> KokiCraft Network was an online organization I founded in 2014 with only $30. It was 1st GTA Minecraft Server in China according to MCBBS, generating ~$500/month in revenue while serving close to 350,000 players with 10 sub-servers of different gameplay. I maintained monthly updates to introduce new elements in the game for a better user experience. I even recruited a customer support team from authorized players. The server defended against ~50 DDoS attacks /month.'

We recruited 10% of the student population, becoming SSFS’ biggest student club. We even helped sponsor SSFS MakerSpace. So far, I have led the team to 5 robotics competitions and the U.S. Science & Engineering Festival. For the day-to-day, I plan weekly meetings, delegate tasks, and teach members tech skills, both software and hardware.<br/>'

From learning painting, designing animations, and making independent video games… From my first public game server with 344,941 users in 2015 to self-studying Deep Learning on Udacity nano-degree, my exploration in many fields of science led me to explore the applications of Artificial Intelligence in different areas as well. Through learning AI, I earned the opportunity to compete on Kaggle and discuss tricks with many data scientists and PhDs. From Playground to Research competitions, I have to read many of the latest publications and have also sometimes implemented recently published papers into my algorithms to improve my models. Like so, new challenges begin as I wake up every morning.

From my first public game server with 18k of users in 2015 to self-studying Deep Learning on Udacity nano-degree, my exploration on many fields of science led me to Artificial Inteligence field. In there, I have erned the opportunities to compete on Kaggle and discuss tricks with many data scientists and phds. From Playground to Research, I have to implement papers published last month to my algorisms to improve my models. Like so, new challenges begin as I wake up every morning.

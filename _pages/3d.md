Shelter tells the story of Rin, a 17-year-old girl who lives her life inside of a futuristic simulation completely by herself in infinite, beautiful loneliness. Each day, Rin awakens in virtual reality and uses a tablet which controls the simulation to create a new, different, beautiful world for herself. Until one day, everything changes, and Rin comes to learn the true origins behind her life inside a simulation.

## The Art of Exhibition
I intended to create a collection of individual objects that is relevent to the original music radio. Each object should have a cubical 3D model with texture. I can render each of them after applied texture.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3d/image7.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>An Image from the Internet that Demonstrates How Individual Cubical Objects can be Rendered</figcaption>
</figure>

The final display of a collection will look like this:
The assembled object will create a 3D scene for the story.

  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3d/image2.png" alt="">

</figure>

## Object Design and Inspiration
<figure class="align-left">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3d/image4.png" alt="">

</figure>

This is Rin's bear from the original music video. It is a reuccuring symbol throughout the video, at the same time, it is the last gift that Rin recieved from her father: also probably the last gift she recived from Earth. Besides the iPad, the bear is the only thing that she held walking into the spaceship.

There are more images of them from different angles:

<figure class="align-left" style="width: 150px">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3d/image15.png" alt="">
</figure>

Her IPad has the ability to create everything in the virtual reality by drawing.

</figure>
<figure class="align-left" style="width: 150px">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3d/image12.png" alt="">
</figure>

It also can recieve messages from Earth. However, the time passes quickly. She have not recieved any message for a long time.

There is also a design of the spaceship in the video for less than a second. Therefore, I used this image to model the spaceship on 3D object-creation softwares.


END.
